How to compile the "WheatSim" crop model:
1. Download "CUDA (Runtime) Toolkit" here "https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads". The CUDA version used for WheatSim development is 12.5. "CUDA (Runtime) Toolkit" is not "CuDNN", and "CuDNN" is not needed for WheatSim.
2. Install "CUDA (Runtime) Toolkit" and that will automatically install Nsight compiler and an API for your Visual Studio.
3. After you installed "CUDA (Runtime) Toolkit", open Visual Studio->new project, you will see that "cuda runtime" option. That means you are ready to go.
4. Download WheatSim crop model and compile.
